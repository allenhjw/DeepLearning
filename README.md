#### This project is to develop segmentation deep learning algorithm using pre-trained model. 
The RPN network is using resNet50 while the backbone model, RCNN, is evaluated using existing models found in pytorch.
The training image used is from https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/ped_html/, that consist of various image from street.

In the network is then used to trained with different medical image for tissue segmentation. The medical cannot be provded due to its proprietary by the owner.
